# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that we have brought to the web! This project allows players to enjoy a seamless, interactive Tic Tac Toe experience in their browser. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following best practices in modular code organization.

## Features

- Interactive gameboard displayed in the browser

- Players take turns placing their marks (X or O)

- Checks for winning conditions and ties

- Restart game button for easy replays

- Organized code structure using JavaScript factories

## How It Works

The game consists of three main components:

- Gameboard: Stores the board as an array and manages updates.

- Cell factory: Manages placing and getting markers.

- Game Controller: Handles the creation of plyer object and game logic, including turns, checking for wins, and managing player interactions.

- Display Controller: Manages the user interface and updates the DOM.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``` cd tic-tac-toe ```

3. Open index.html in your browser to play the game.

## Future Updates

### Version 2 Coming Soon! ðŸŽ‰

Version 2 of this project will introduce a Somali version of Tic Tac Toe. Unlike the traditional game, the Somali variant does not allow draws. When all the pieces are placed on the board and no winner has been determined, the game continues by allowing players to move pieces to open spaces until a winner emerges.
